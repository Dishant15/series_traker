series_traker
=============
Series tracker is a python app that trackes new episodes launched of few of my favourite series.
Script tracks updates from arrow , S.H.I.E.L.D , Big Bang Theory , Game Of Thrones , Atlantis(2013), Silicon Vally , Da vinci's Deamons and The Walking Dead.
When a new episode is launched it shows as a red marker.
Click the '+' button for that series and script will automatically open the download link for you in your default webbrowser and update this development in database that you have seen this episode.
So here you can get online updates of all your favourite series at one click.
The most annoying part of my Series watching time to go on different webpages to see if new episode is there yet is finally Over.
