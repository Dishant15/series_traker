series_traker
=============
Series tracker is a python app that trackes new episodes launched of few of my favourite series.
Script tracks updates from arrow , S.H.I.E.L.D , Big Bang Theory , How I Met Your Mother , Atlantis(2013).
When a new episode is launched it shows as a red marker in GUI lable.
Finally watch the episode and press the Update button for that series to indicate script about the development.
So here you can get online updates of all your favourite series at one click.
(This was the most annoying part of my Series watching time to go on different webpages to see if new episode is there yet.)
